# Magnetic-levitation-control

Experimental project for the Automatic Control course (BSc, 3rd year, 2019).
- Levitation system identification and linearization
- State-space control design and simulation (Simulink)
- Conditioning and filtering circuit design for analog I/O
- Control system implementation on Arduino

Two videos showing the circuits and the levitating ball with external perturbation can be found at https://bit.ly/3dQXpWN and https://bit.ly/300LmOk.
